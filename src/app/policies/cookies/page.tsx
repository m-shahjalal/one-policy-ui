          question: "Why do I need a Cookie Policy?",
          answer:
            "A Cookie Policy is required by privacy laws like GDPR and ePrivacy Directive if your website uses cookies. It informs users about what cookies you use, how you use them, and gives them control over their data. Beyond legal requirements, it builds trust with your visitors by being transparent about data collection.",
        },
        {
          question: "How often should I update my Cookie Policy?",
          answer:
            "You should update your Cookie Policy whenever you change how you use cookies, add new cookies or tracking technologies, or when relevant privacy laws change. We recommend reviewing your policy at least every 6 months to ensure it remains current and compliant.",
        },
        {
          question: "Will this Cookie Policy work for my specific website?",
          answer:
            "Our Cookie Policy generator creates customized policies based on your specific website, the cookies you use, and the jurisdictions you operate in. The result is a tailored policy that addresses your unique needs.",

        {
          question: "Do I need a Cookie Banner as well?",
          answer:
            "Yes, in many jurisdictions (especially under GDPR), you need both a Cookie Policy and a Cookie Consent Banner. The policy provides detailed information, while the banner obtains user consent before non-essential cookies are set. Our solution can help you implement both.",
